## Public cloud services market will see the fastest growth in spending, with a five-year CAGR of 21.3%
To maintain strategic competitiveness, today’s CEOs and business leaders are focused on realizing _growth and digital business change_. Like so many things, the story starts with the **pandemic**, which forced companies to adopt a more technologically sophisticated approach to managing customer service.

This Traditional IT model was born out of _ITIL and On-Premises_ based technology solutions. As a result of this, if we attempt to apply this Traditional IT model to _Cloud-based_ technologies we run into many issues. Cloud as-a-Service for infrastructure, platforms, and various software offerings continues to be the largest, and fastest increasing, engine of growth for the whole cloud market [^1].

## We need to manage your journey through all of these different channels 
Moving forward, the fundamentals driving the cloud market will continue to shift with the transition to a **digital-first** economy. Digital commerce catch-up and scaling and digital remote working have become the center of attention. 

Naturally a lot of digital native business thrived with double digit growth. **Cloud native** technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. It is not enough to view every company as a software company. 

> _"Now, every CIO is a cloud operator"_ - **Paul Cormier**, RedHat CEO [^2].

## Focus on "Outcomes" first and "as a Service" second
As a service model is not a silver bullet. Even the largest cloud providers suffer outages that can impact an organization’s ability to conduct business [^3].  More than **30,000 impacted customers** observed Google 404 errors on their websites [^4]. To alleviate this, many providers offer multiple availability zones so organizations can failover from one zone to another when and if a disaster or outage strikes. Remember that putting all your eggs in the same basket may be a very bad idea for your _mission-critical_ services.

CEOs and business leaders are focused on recovering revenue, profit and growth to pre-pandemic levels. Obviously, the as-a-service solution a customer chooses depends first on the functionality the customer requires, and the expertise it has on staff.
