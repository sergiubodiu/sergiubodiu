## The compound effect
All good things in life come from __#compounding__, be it __knowledge__, __health__ and even __wealth__! The compound effect meaning is exactly what it sounds like. As you may know from finance, compound interest can lead to surprisingly large returns. A penny that doubles in value each day for *31 days* ends up being worth over __$10 million__.

Same concept is applied to __Learning__. Read something like even 5 pages a day. Write something you like, it does not matter how long it is. Discover new methods to take photos if you are in love with photography. Enter the world of podcasts and educational stuff. Watch documentaries along with scientific movies.

__*__ Changpeng Zhao [3] has become one of the richest people in the world, even without his crypto holdings. The **Annualised Return** is based on the investment of 15M in 2017 and the recent report on his wealth. Per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his wealth even eclipses that of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious and—to date—anonymous creator of Bitcoin. 

CZ's fortune dwarfs those of many of the crypto industry’s biggest names, including FTX CEO __Sam Bankman-Fried__ (who holds $22.5 billion according to Forbes), and Coinbase CEO __Brian Armstrong__ (who holds $9.6 billion). Reports last year indicate that Satoshi's crypto holdings amount to as many as 1.1 million Bitcoin, worth $45.8 billion at today's prices.

## Small Changes, Big Results

__Consistency__ is the key to achieving and maintaining momentum. Similarly, in our personal life, small changes maintained consistently over time lead to unexpectedly dramatic results. Eating __100 fewer calories__ per day for an entire year would cause you to lose __4 kg__. Spending 30 minutes reading each day could, over a year, lead to dramatic self-improvement and new ideas. 

> *"A daily routine built on good habits and disciplines separates the most successful among us from everyone else. A routine is exceptionally powerful."* __Darren Hardy__, The Compound Effect

James Lawrence [6] did the impossible and conquered 50 grueling Ironmans in 50 days. So for 2015, the 36-year-old athlete set out to do the unthinkable: to complete *50 triathlons, in 50 days, in 50 different states*. That's 3.86 km of swimming, 180.25 km of cycling and a full 42.20 km marathon run every day for 50 days straight. 

James broke that record in 2021 during the __"Conquer 100"__ [7] in which he completed 100 consecutive Ironman length triathlons in 100 days. He then completed one more for a total of 101 in 101 consecutive days.

## Investment checklist

When you buy a stock, you are buying part of an enterprise. Whether it's 10 shares of Facebook or several million shares. Consider it no different than if you were buying the company in its entirety.

- Founder-led?
- Growth at a reasonable price?

  <figcaption>Make a list of all of the positive attributes that a "perfect" company would have and a list of all the attributes that you want to avoid in an investment. Determine a maximum score for the positive attributes, start with 100 for simplicity</figcaption>

Determine a maximum negative score for the negative attributes, Brian uses -54 (to counter-balance the positive weightings). Assign the 100 points, giving more weight to the most important attributes. Repeat for attributes that you want to avoid and keep __tweaking the checklist__ until you are happy. Is your system working? and are you beating the market?  If not, why? Make changes to your system to make it better ask the #fintwit community.
