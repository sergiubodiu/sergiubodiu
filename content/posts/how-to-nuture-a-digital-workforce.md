Traditional organization structure follow a top down approach with ideas and strategy defined at the top then distributed to specialized teams that focus on specific technologies, processes, or resources.

Unfortunately, it’s easy to quickly lose sight of the larger business objectives as the work is divided into more and more specialized teams. This creates a silo effect where working teams are insulated from sister teams, and isolated from the larger organization. The end result is that it generally takes far longer than expected to deliver a product and it often falls well short of the vision.

Requirements are handed down and reinterpreted in the language of the team, often losing some aspect of the goal. This leads to a waterfall approach to design and delivery which ultimately leads to late integration between teams where design flaws and omissions often surface and require extensive rework or lengthy procurement cycles to correct.

## Manage the balance between technology and employee skills

We need to flip the pyramid and enable self-service creation. The cloud is a means, not an end. Success in modernizing IT through the cloud is driven by a complete standardization and automation strategy.

I believe that cloud adoption has become increasingly easier and possible because of the cloud-ecosystem of products, vendors and a vast library of customer references that we have available to us today.

## What can you do when you transform your organization?
A major outcome of transformation is that your organization becomes open to the possibility of integrating and adopting new technologies and business processes. This can help you meet business goals in industries that are constantly evolving.



> To be the catalyst in communities of customers, contributors, and partners creating better technology the open source way. - Red Hat 

Employees thrive when they have the right technology, the knowledge to use that technology, and the freedom to learn, experiment, and improve things. A good way to think about this is freedom within a framework — employers create the framework, or decision rights, and beyond that employees are able to redefine and redesign work to get the best results.
