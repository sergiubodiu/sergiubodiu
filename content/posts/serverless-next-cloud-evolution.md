## The cloud continutes growing. 
Increasingly, developers are moving to a "cloud native" application development approach. Serverless Computing allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. With serverless computing, your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by a cloud provider like Alibaba[1], AWS[2], Azure[3], GCP[4], IBM[5] (RedHat[6]) etc.

The cloud doesn’t stop growing. In fact, its development is speeding up. Since many businesses are forced to function in a remote environment, a large number of them have decided to adopt Cloud services to be able to operate normally. Numerous companies that were indecisive about digital transformation have now acknowledged the benefits of  migrating to the cloud since having been further substantiated by the pandemic.
