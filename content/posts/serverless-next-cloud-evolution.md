## The cloud continutes growing. 

Increasingly, developers are moving to a "cloud native" application development approach. **Serverless Computing** allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. With serverless computing, your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by a **cloud provider** like Alibaba [^1], AWS [^2], Azure [^3], GCP [^4], IBM [^5] (RedHat [^6]) etc.

The cloud doesn’t stop growing. In fact, the growth is accelerating up. Since many businesses are forced to function in a _remote environment_, a large number of them have decided to adopt Cloud services to be able to _operate normally_. Decade‑long digital transformation **roadmaps** got _compressed into days and weeks_ in order to respond to the realities of shelter in place. **95%** of all companies are seeking new ways of engaging customers as a result of COVID‑19. [^7].

## Serverless belongs in your application development strategy

Serverless is a significant breakthrough in the IT industry and has gained popularity in the past few years. The use of serverless architecture has very quickly become an accepted approach for organizations deploying cloud applications, with a plethora of choices available for deployment. Start building your future - create **next generation** of _efficient, flexible and cost-effective solutions_ by deploying serverless functions on your favourite cloud.
