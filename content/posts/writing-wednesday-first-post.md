A few years ago, I wanted to start a blog. Anyone can write. All it takes is knowing a language and stringing words together. But learning to write well is a whole different story.  Perhaps you’ve read a couple of books to improve your writing skills. And you’ve subscribed to the most popular blogs on writing.

I didn’t start the blog then, and figured that it’s not too late to start now.  Of course, we all have skills we've inherited and opportunities we didn't deserve. But what we do with these gifts and opportunities is what separates the outliers from the rest of the pack. 
I have learned this lesson countless times, especially during business trips and when meeting new people or interviewing sources. The difference between a professional and an amateur is simple — it’s practice. The amateur quits; the pro never gives up.

You do this by forming a habit of writing every day. Do it so frequently that you don't even have to think about it, so much that your brain doesn't have time to feel fear. That’s what the pros do. They don't beat the fear or fight through it; they do the thing afraid. And it’s what you and I must do, too, if we're going to get serious about our craft. I also thought it might be fun to continue on with the challenge here even though it’s a weird time of the year to start a 52 week writing challenge - "Writing Wednesday".
