The rotation out of tech stocks continues to hammer cloud companies the hardest, as investors sell out of last year’s best performers.

I really think there is a misconception that as we reopen the economy, we are all going to stop using cloud-computing solutions, and that’s not really true.\nOngoing disruption to IT markets by cloud will be amplified by the introduction of new technologies, including distributed cloud. Many will further blur the lines between traditional and cloud offerings. The move to cloud is still just beginning. Only 10-15% of enterprise IT spending has moved to the cloud so far, and 20-30% of workflows.\n Figure 3: This trend indicates it’s more critical than ever to get a handle on 'forecasting and cost optimization')   In 2022, more than $1.3 trillion in enterprise IT spending is at stake from the shift to cloud, growing to almost $1.8 trillion in 2025, according to Gartner 4. Above all else, don’t believe the biggest myth about cloud — that you always save money by moving to it. This is sometimes the case, but there are many other reasons for migrating to the cloud. High growth stocks were crushed during this bear-market but many high quality businesses have now become reasonably valued 5.\nNo certainties in this business, but many growth stocks appear to have bottomed out. It’s tempting to avoid cloud stocks entirely and stick with recession-resistant plays in this growling bear market, but investors could be leaving a lot of money on the table by avoiding this high-growth sector. After all, the global cloud market could still grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.7% between 2022 and 2030, according to Grand View Research 6.\nWhat is the future of cloud  Stating “we’re all in” is not a strategy. Likewise, a plan to shut down the data center is not a cloud strategy.\n Debunking these myths will be critical for organizations. The cloud strategy should be the foundation for the implementation plans. The cloud strategy needs to be comprehensive, explicitly stated and separate from implementation plans.\n Figure 4: (@swardley) built a beautiful graph on the Enterprise IT adoption Cycle   All business decisions, including those about cloud, are ultimately about money. Even if agility is the ultimate goal, cost is still a concern. Don’t assume you will save money unless you have done the hard work of honestly analyzing your situation. Utilize total cost of ownership (TCO) and other models on a case-by-case basis. Segment cloud into use cases.
